A simple Keypad for logins. It uses a loop to create numbers 1-9. This allows for cleaner code and easy readability. Clock in/out buttons don't work, I have another script I'm working on at the moment, to see if I can get a system that I am happy with. I used a dictionary to store my datatable, It works fin for a small project but, it's not scalible. I know how to use sqlite3 and mysql now but, at the time of coding this, I had no idea what those were, much less how to use them.
You are free to do what you want with the script.

Much love ~ Raku
